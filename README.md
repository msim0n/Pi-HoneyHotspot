# Pi-HoneyHotspot
The goal is to set up a raspberry pi as a fake hotspot wifi. In order to make a portable honeypot.
Here, a raspberry pi 3 is used for the project.
On the wiki, all the step are more detailed.

### 1 Hotspot wifi
This is perfomed with Hostapd, DNSMasq.

### 2 Fake Wifi portal
We need to steal or make a fake wifi login page to seem it real.

### 3 Honeypot
Here we'll collect all the credential or the information we can have that seem relevant.
